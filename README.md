Manchurian is a class of Indian Chinese dishes made by roughly chopping and deep-frying a main ingredient like chicken, cauliflower (gobi), prawn, fish, mutton or paneer cheese and then saut√©eing it in a sauce flavored with soy sauce.Manchurian is the result of the adaptation of Chinese cooking and seasoning techniques to suit Indian tastes and has become a staple of Indian Chinese cuisine.

History
The word "Manchurian" means native or inhabitant of Manchuria, but the dish is basically a creation of Chinese restaurants in India, and bears little resemblance to traditional Manchu cuisine or Chinese cuisine.[3] It is said to have been invented in 1975 by Nelson Wang, a cook at the Cricket Club of India in Mumbai, when a customer asked him to create a new dish, different from what was available on the menu.[4] Wang described his invention process as starting from the basic ingredients of an Indian dish, namely chopped garlic, ginger, and green chilis, but next, instead of adding garam masala, he put in soy sauce, followed by cornstarch and the chicken itself.[5] A popular vegetarian variant replaces chicken with cauliflower,[2] and is commonly known as gobi manchurian. Other vegetarian variants include mushroom, baby corn, veggie ball Manchurian.[citation needed]

Variations
There are two different variants of Manchurian, dry and with gravy. Both variants are prepared by using common ingredients like corn flour, maida flour, spring onion, bell peppers, soy sauce, chili sauce, minced garlic, ground pepper, etc. and has typical garnish of spring onion. Some recipes call for use of monosodium glutamate (MSG) to increase the taste profile, though there are those who avoid it due to health concerns.[6] Its taste can vary from mildly spicy to hot and fiery based on the recipe and personal preference.
